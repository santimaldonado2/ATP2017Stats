# ATP2017Stats
Open Data Visualization Project as practice homework for the **Master in Data Science &amp; Big Data** in **[AFI - Escuela de Finanzas](https://www.afiescueladefinanzas.es/)**

The objective of this project was to evaluate the knowledge gained in three subjects, Open-Data and Static and Dynamic Visualization. The result is deployed [here](https://santiagomaldonado.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/)

## About the Homework
### Open Data
The aim of this course was learn to interact with open data source. So I use the [ATP World Tour tennis data](https://datahub.io/sports-data/atp-world-tour-tennis-data) available in datahub. I also use the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to obtain the coordinates of the city where the tournaments are played.

### Static Visualization
In this subject we were told how to make static visualization of data so a lot of insights could be gained from it. The results could be seen inside the "Psychology or Talent?" tab, where I analyzed Rafael Nadal statistics.

### Dynamic Visualization
Here we learned how to make dynamic visualizations so the user could play with some parameters, then the information changes allowing he/she to take his/her own conclusions. So I made a dynamic dashboard where you can choose a player and a surface and analyze the information.


## About the Code

If you want to run it locally, you can clone this repo. I use the following packages
```
shiny
shinydashboard
leaflet
shiny
jsonlite
dplyr
ggplot2
RColorBrewer
dplyr
```
After you installed all those packages, you can run the project executing the file `runApp.R`
